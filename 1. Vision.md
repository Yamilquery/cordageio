## What is a Vision?
A vision is a **clear**, comprehensive 'photograph' of an organization at some point in the future. 
It provides direction because it describes what the organization needs to be like, to be successful 
within the future.

_What is Cordage's Vision?_
# A world with more valuable and reliable products, interactions and services.

#### How?
Cordage is a medium agnostic company, but has a preference for delivering high-quality software
solutions. In some cases, we will help our clients achieve excellence with code, in others with 
knowledge, tutorials, or maybe even consulting.

#### Why does this matter?
**We can save lives by helping companies achieve excellence.** Quality products are less prone 
to having deffects. This means less fires due to faulty Christmas lights, less injuries due to faulty Airbags, and less E.Colli outbreaks.

Quality and excellence can help companies grow, increase their perceived value. **Growing companies mean 
more jobs and better quality of life for everyone involved.**

We have an obligation with the world to help every single company and individual achieve excellence and deliver more value.

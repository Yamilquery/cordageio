Ubiquitous Language is the term Eric Evans uses in  [Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321125215)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321601912)  for the practice of building up a common, rigorous language between developers and users. This language should be based on the [Domain Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html)  used in the software - hence the need for it to be rigorous, since software doesn't cope well with ambiguity.

Evans makes clear that using the ubiquitous language between in conversations with domain experts is an important part of testing it, and hence the domain model. He also stresses that the language (and model) should evolve as the team's understanding of the domain grows.

## Glossary Contexts

|Context|Description|
|--|--|
|DDD|Domain Driven Design. Set of patterns for building enterprise applications from the domain model out|
|[CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)|Two-fold layered architecture with parallel sections for handling command and query sides. Each section can be architected independently, even with a separate supporting architecture, whether that is DDD or client/server.|
|[Sales and Marketing Terms](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)|Two-fold layered architecture with parallel sections for handling command and query sides. Each section can be architected independently, even with a separate supporting architecture, whether that is DDD or client/server.|
|[Rigging](https://github.com/cordageio/rigging/blob/master/docs/ubiquitous/glossary/README.md)|Rigging is a the name given to the context that manages: Organizations, Locations, Teams, Users, and user Security.|
|RBAC|Role Based Access Control is a way to prevent unauthorized access to documents and preferences to limited users. This is a standard functionality in large enterprises. RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. These are used to enforce these policies without any complication.|
|Frontend|Frontend is the graphical interface that allows a user to view and interact with data. This is also called the interaction layer and is mostly built with HTML, CSS and Javascript (Pure or with tools like React)|
|On-Premise|On-premises (abbreviated as "on-prem" or incorrectly said as "on-premise") is software that is installed and managed by the client organization in their own servers.|
|Billing| Refers to the automated process of sending an invoice/bill to a customer in exchange for goods or services rendered.|
|Logs-reports-notifications|A log, in a computing context, is the automatically produced and time-stamped documentation of events relevant to a particular system. A report is the grouping of log activities to provide value to the end user. A notification is an action triggered by an event registered in the log. At Cordage we grouped these three elements inside a context because they all revolve around the registration of an event.|

## Glossary

|Concept|Context|Description|
|--|--|--|
|Event Sourcing|DDD|Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events. Layered architecture that is almost always inspired by a CQRS design that focuses its logic on events rather than plain data. Events are treated as first-class data, and any other queryable information is inferred from stored events.|
|Domain Model|DDD|Layered architecture based on a presentation layer, an application layer, a domain layer, and an infrastructure layer, designed in accordance with the DDD development style. In particular, the model is expected to be a special type of object model.|
|Client/server architecture|DDD|Classic two-layer (or two-tier) architecture that consists only of presentation plus data access.|
|Multitier architecture|DDD|Segmentation that is in many ways similar to that of a multilayer architecture except that now multiple tiers are involved instead of layers. (More on the possible downsides of a layer-to-tier mapping in a moment.)|
|Multilayer architecture|DDD|Canonical segmentation based on presentation, business, and data layers. The architecture might come in slightly different flavors, such as an additional application layer between the presentation and business layers and with the business layer transformed into a domain layer by the use of a DDD development style. Layered architecture is just another name for a multilayer architecture. Weâ€™ll be using the term layered architecture instead of multilayer in the rest of this chapter and throughout the book.|
|Monolithic architecture|DDD|The context is a standalone application or service that exposes an API to the rest of the world. Typical examples are autonomous web services (for example, Web API host) and Windows services. Yet another example is an application hosting a SignalR engine.|
|Aggregate|CQRS|A larger unit of encapsulation than just a class. Every transaction is scoped to a single aggregate. The lifetimes of the components of an aggregate are bounded by the lifetime of the entire aggregate. Concretely, an aggregate will handle commands, apply events, and have a state model encapsulated within it that allows it to implement the required command validation, thus upholding the invariants (business rules) of the aggregate.|
|Aggregate Root|CQRS|The aggregate forms a tree or graph of object relations. The aggregate root is the "top" one, which speaks for the whole and may delegates down to the rest. It is important because it is the one that the rest of the world communicates with.|
|Command|CQRS|Commands are things that indicate **requests** to our domain. While an event states that something certainly happened, a command may be **accepted** or **rejected**. An accepted command leads to zero or more events being emitted to incorporate new facts into the system. A rejected command leads to some kind of exception.|
|Projections|CQRS|is a read-only view of some application state, built up from the published domain events.|
|Projectors|CQRS|A projection is built by a projector module defined as an event handler: it receives each published domain event and updates the read model. So a projection is read model state that is projected from domain events by a projector.|
|Queries|CQRS|is a request for data or information from a database.|
|Anticorruption layer|CQRS|Indicates an extra layer of code that hides to the downstream context any changes implemented at some point in the upstream context.|
|Shared kernel|CQRS|Two contexts share a subset of the model. Contexts are therefore tightly coupled, and no team can change the shared kernel without synchronizing with the other team.|
|Validators|CQRS|It serve to create validation rules for the current context. For example, unique email validation|
|Support Middlewares|CQRS|is an the extension point to include cross-cutting concerns into command dispatch. This can be used to add in command validation, authorization, logging, and other behaviour that you want to be called for every command the router dispatches. You define your own middleware modules and register them in your command router. They are executed before, and after success or failure, of every dispatched command.|
|Support Validators|CQRS|Here are all the common validation rules to execute during the execution of commands. For instance, UUID parse validation|
|Billing Admin|RBAC|This user is registered on the Cordage Public Cloud site. This role only has authorization to everything related to billing administration. This role can also assign a Quality Coordinator to a location|
|System Admin|RBAC|This user is created during On-Premise installation. Conversely, for Public Cloud accounts, this user will be provided once their purchase is made. This role is authorized to access all the functionality of Cordage.|
|Organization Admin|RBAC|This user is created by the System Admin. Once an organization has been created, users with the right roles, should be able to make Cordage their own. Set their preferences for multiple aspects of their organization. Organization management and preferences are applied to all locations. This works like the constitution, all locations can have their own settings and preferences, but they will follow the organizational guidelines. This role can also assign a Quality Coordinator to a location|
|Quality Manager|RBAC| This user is the person responsible for quality at an organization. A quality manager may be in mid-management and is in charge of compliance at a location. This user is authorized to create requests to add new solutions for their organization, it also can do location management, get usage reports, manage teams, manage RBAC and require rights according to GDPR compliance and also browse and perform certain actions in the marketplace|
|Quality Coordinator|RBAC|A quality coordinator is someone that works for the Quality Manager. This role will exist at larger organizations. This user is authorized to manage teams, and the common tasks|
|Editor|RBAC| An editor is everyone in the system with write permissions in the system.  This user is authorized to all the ~~common tasks (TODO: Add reference)~~. This profile is relevant because Cordage will charge clients based on editors.|
|Organization Member|RBAC|An organization member is a user with read credentials for the system. This type of user is the one with the least amount of permissions. ~~TODO: Who or how does creates this user?.~~|
|On-Premise Installation||Large Enterprise companies want to control their infrastructure to abide to their internal policies. These installs are called on-premise. On Premise might be a private cloud, a hybrid cloud or bare metal. The IT Manager at the organization needs a way to install, update and manage Cordage inside their own infrastructure so that he can comply with internal security and privacy standards, and deliver value to his internal clients.|
|Location||Once an organization has been created there is a need for a location. An organization can have one or several locations. A large manufacturing organization can have a factory in Monterrey, another factory in Puebla and an office in Mexico City. Locations may or may not have a quality department in each of the factories. Documents and processes may, or may not be shared across locations as well. When a large organization needs to have clarity regarding costs, processes or payments they need multi-location management.|
|Security||Large companies have security policies that need to be followed to comply with their security standards. While this is mostly reserved for larger enterprise clients, security is a constant. Whenever a system administrator needs to manage security preferences and stick to policy they want to be able to set organization wise standards.|
|Onboarding||Whenever a new user starts using the software, the user should be assisted towards the "A ha!" moment. Proper onboarding helps with adoption and reduces the need and cost for training new users.|
|Credential||All users need to log-in to the system. Credentials is a catch-all name for all things related to the user and user logic like password resets, account activations and account verification.|
|System and Core Usage Logs||Logs are important for traceability of the software and compliance. Logs is one of the features often requested by enterprise clients.|
|System Notifications for Core Usage||System notifications are a way in which users discover about changes done to their accounts or organizations. Users need to be informed in order to understand what's going on with their accounts.|
|Usage Reports for Core Usage||Usage reports for the core of the app is a way to reinforce to the org that the solution is being used, and by whom. This section is also useful to understand who is using the system, why and which sections specifically. This section may eventually allow us to design gamification and improve the onboarding process.|
|Resource||A resource defines a logical grouping of one or more files. It can be a document.doc, document.xlsx, document.csv, video.mp4, audio.mp3, folder, compress.zip, etc. See [Resource Compatible Types](http://todo.put.link.here) for more information|
|Solutions||A solution is the name we have given the apps or plugins that connect with Cordage's core. A solution serves as a free standing product that can be sold individually or as a package/"Suite". Some examples of a solution include: "Corrective Actions and Preventive Actions", "Document Control", "Training" and "After service response"|

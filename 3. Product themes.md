## What is a product theme?
According to [Jared Spool](https://medium.com/uie-brain-sparks/themes-a-small-change-to-product-roadmaps-with-large-effects-a9a9a496b800), Themes are a promise to solve a problem without the commitment of delivering a certain feature. Specific product features need to have alignment to the themes. 

## Corgage's product themes

### Enterprise Ready
| We believe    | The Problem   | The Opportunity |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| Larger enterprises are more interested in quality management and compliance than  smaller companies. Enterprise and Midmarket enterprise need to stick to stricter standards. | Larger companies deal with legacy systems, compliance documents and bureaucracy. Their current infrastructures don't always play well with their infrastructures or security policies. | Enterprise companies have larger budgets and look for tools that can adapt to their needs and standards.|

### Integrations
| We believe    | The Problem   | The Opportunity |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| Clients don't want to be locked with a single solution provider. Clients want the best tools and they don't want their processes to be interrupted.| Most current solutions try to lock-in the client with their current solutions, forcing companies to have information silos or have them work with double entries of data.| The opportunity is to connect with solutions currently being used at our client organizations to become ever more present in their internal processes|


### Scalability and Modularity
| We believe    | The Problem   | The Opportunity |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| Technology changes quickly, and we need to be able to adapt and provide the best solution at the best cost possible.| As a project grows, so does it's level of complexity. The cost of maintenance and acquired technical debt make launching new features complicated.| The opportunity is to design and implement an architecture that is modular enough that the software doesn't rely on a single technology or technology provider.|

### Ease of Use
| We believe    | The Problem   | The Opportunity |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| Current enterprise solutions feel old, and the Millenials joining the workforce expect products to feel like consumer internet.| Training hundreds, or even thousands of employees and ensuring adoption is tough. Bad UX may mean more technical support than it should.| Good user experience can help adoption, retention and evangelization for the product inside client organizations and out.|


### Partnerships
| We believe    | The Problem   | The Opportunity |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
|Quality is a team activity. Software helps, but continious improvement and value delivery requires organizationwide commitment.|Quality professionals are dispersed accross multiple industries and don't always communicate with each others.| Partnerships and the community at large can help quality professionals make the most of their experience with Cordage.|

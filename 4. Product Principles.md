# What is a product principle?
Product principles work as a manifesto and speak to the nature of the product. 
Principles guide the decision making process and help the team align to what is expected.

## Cordage Product Principles:
### Think big, deliver quality and value on time:
We focus on the long-term for the product. You need to think big and stick to the 
mission of helping companies achieve excellence and deliver value. Nevertheless, we can't delay release trains. 
You need to plan your work accordingly. You are hereby empowered to reduce the scope but you can never compromise 
quality. We believe in half-products not half-assed products.

### Explore and Remix:
Cool new technology and engineering processes are great. We encourage the exploration. However we don't believe in
reinventing the wheel for every product. We believe in DRY. Do not repeat yourself. We believe in being inspired by 
solutions and copy what we like and disregard what we don't. There are smarter and more experienced people out there.
Learn from them, copy and use those solutions. [Run less software](https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/). 

### Rinse and repeat:
We believe our first attempt at doing something is probably wrong. Cordage promotes cyclical learning. We expect you
to do prototypes, to experiment and â€“most importantly, to learn. With your new discoveries, your new knowledge and 
your new experience propose how it can be done better.
